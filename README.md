# HungrySpectator2.0

This website will utilize at least 2 APIs, an AJAX call for data, polished front end, quality coding standards, repeating elements, bootstrap, deployed github page, user input validation and firebase. This was my first project created during my time at Northwestern. I am specifically remaking this project to continue my practice of coding.
